# AVIATION ACCIDENTS TRENDS 

# OVERVIEW
This project analyzes aviation accidents' data from 1980 upto 2022, to study trends of accidents and how it can be used to influence Uzima company's decision in the purchase and operation of aircrafts. Some of the approaches used in this project are borrowed from the [Part 121 Accident Survivability - NTSB](https://www.ntsb.gov/safety/data/Pages/Part121AccidentSurvivability.aspx). I will use data cleaning, imputation, analysis, and visualization to generate insights for the company. 

# BUSINESS PROBLEM
Uzima company can use data from [Aviation Accident Database - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses/data?select=AviationData.csv) to draw actionable insights on which aircrafts to invest and its potential risks. The purpose of this project is to help determine which airplanes are the lowest risk for the company to start this business endeavour. From the data, I was able to pose the following questions to help make the next steps. 

The business questions posed are:
1. What are the accidents trends over the years?
2. What are the potential risks based on accidents and occupants' survivability?
3. What are the risks based on purpose of flight between commercial and private?
 
 # DATA UNDERSTANDING 
In the data folder is a dataset from the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.
The data we're going to use is contained in the AviationData.csv file; Which has records about the aircraft makes, the accidents' data, injury severity and outcomes etc. that will be used to answer our business questions.

## Data Analysis
Time Series analysis:
Plotted accidents counts over time to identify trends in aviation accidents. 
Injury outcomes counts  were plotted over time, to analyse occupants survivability. 
Comparative analysis: compared accidents trends by aircraft manufacturer to find which aircraft has the lowest risk ove time.
Decriptive analysis: found the count of number of accidents per year and visualized accidents' frequencies in tableau.

# RESULTS
Analyses revealed that Beech airlines are the best option to purchase because it has the lowest risk in terms of accident trends. 


Most airline accidents are survivable.
There is a higher count of uninjured passengers compared to other injury outcomes

Commercial aircrafts show lower count of injury outcomes.

Commercial aircrafts can withstand weather conditions better.




They also sustain damages better during accidents.

# CONCLUSIONS 
Beech airlines is the best choice for purchase and operation. 
The aviation business is a worthy venture to undertake.
Commercial airlines are a better choice for purchase. 


# NEXT STEPS 
Show accidents occurrence based on broad phase of flight. 
Use data on model of aircrafts to determine commonly used aircrafts for each category.
Analyze accidents trends based on  Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) of aircrafts.
